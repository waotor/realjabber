Real-time text is text transmitted instantly while it is being typed or created. The recipient can immediately read the sender's text as it is written, without waiting. This is similar to a telephone conversation, where one listens while the other is speaking. It combines the advantages of text messaging, with the advantages of interactive real-time conversation (less than 1 second latency). For more info, see realtimetext.org (R3TF)
