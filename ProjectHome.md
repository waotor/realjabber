<h1>realjabber - Instant Messaging with Real-Time Text</h1>

<b>Real-time text is text transmitted instantly while it is being typed or created.</b> The recipient can immediately read the sender's text as it is written, without waiting. This is similar to a telephone conversation, where one listens while the other is speaking. It combines the advantages of text messaging, with the advantages of interactive real-time conversation (less than 1 second latency).
